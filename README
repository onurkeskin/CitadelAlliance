# Citadel Alliance

A pet non modern visual cpp project. Making use of recast&detour for navmesh generation and basic pathfinding. 
Makes some use of boost asio.


(I have no idea why i did this in visual cpp instead. Probably didnt have access to a linux base os. Also probably have no access to devenv (no docker for older windows) either.)
